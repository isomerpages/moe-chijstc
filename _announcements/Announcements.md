<h4><strong>2025 GCE O-Level Results Release</strong></h4>
<p>&nbsp;Dear Parents/ Guardians,</p>
<p>&nbsp;The 2025 O-Level results will be released next Wednesday, 14 January
2026. All students are to return to their Secondary schools to collect
their results. Details are as follows for your reference.</p>
<p>&nbsp;<strong>Date and time of release of results</strong>: 14 January
2026, 2pm
<br><strong>Venue for students to report to</strong>: School Hall &nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Time of students reporting to venue in school</strong>: 1.30pm&nbsp;&nbsp;
<br><strong>Attire</strong>: IJ Blue with Blouse</p>
<p>&nbsp;You are welcomed to be with your daughters/ wards during the results
release. You will be invited to be seated in the School Hall at 1.45pm.</p>
<p>&nbsp;As this is an official school event, please help remind your daughters/
wards to be in the proper attire and grooming. Students who are not dressed
in accordance with our attire and grooming standards may not be allowed
to enter the school hall for the release of the results. &nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;For students who are unable to collect their results in person,
you can appoint a proxy to collect a physical copy of their results from
the school. Proxies are required to produce the relevant documents for
the school’s verification when collecting the results. Please see the
<a href="/files/Exam TT/Authorisation_letter_for_collection_of_results.pdf" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank">Letter of Authorisation</a>(Appointment of proxy for school candidates
who are unable to collect their results in person) as attached for your
completion. Please print out this letter for the school’s verification
when collecting their results. Do contact the school through their Form
Teacher for assistance if they are unable to appoint a proxy before 13
January 2026. Do also note that the results will be released to the proxies
only after the results release is over in the School Hall.</p>
<p>&nbsp;While we await the results, let us also remember to celebrate the
efforts of each one of our Theresians, regardless of the results. We can
show support for our students by showing them through our words and actions
that their grades do not define who they are.</p>
<p>&nbsp;Your support to your daughters/ wards during this milestone is important.
Use this opportunity to have open conversations and guide them as they
consider their next steps. Please refer below for useful resources to guide
your conversations with your daughters/ wards. They include resources on
social and emotional support as well as education and career guidance.</p>
