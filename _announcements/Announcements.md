<h4><strong>Announcement on the Release and Collection of N-Level Results<br>(18 December, 2:00pm)</strong></h4>
<p>&nbsp;Dear Parents/Guardians,</p>
<p>&nbsp;The 2025 N-Level results will be released this Thursday, 18 December.
All students are to return to their Secondary schools to collect their
results. Details had been sent to them earlier via their respective Google
Classrooms. Details are as follows for your reference.</p>
<p>&nbsp;<strong>Date and time of release of results</strong>: 18 December
2025, 2pm
<br><strong>Venue to report to</strong>: AVA Room (students are to use the
ramp in front of the GO and look out for the signages that will be placed
along the way)
<br><strong>Time of students reporting to venue in school</strong>: 1.30pm&nbsp;&nbsp;
<br><strong>Attire</strong>: IJ Blue with Blouse</p>
<p>&nbsp;As this is an official school event, please help remind your daughter/child
to be in the proper attire and grooming. Those who are not dressed in accordance
with our attire and grooming standards may not be allowed to enter the
school hall for the release of results.</p>
<p>&nbsp;For students who are unable to collect their results in person,
you/they can appoint a proxy to collect a physical copy of their results
from the school. Proxies are required to produce the relevant documents
for the school’s verification when collecting the results. Please see
<a href="/files/Announcement/Authorisation_letter_for_collection_of_results.pdf" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank">Letter of Authorisation</a>(Appointment of proxy for school candidates
who are unable to collect their results in person) as attached for your
completion and for the school’s verification when collecting their results.
Theresians may contact the school through their Form Teacher for assistance
if they are unable to appoint a proxy. Please do so before 18 Dec 2025.</p>
<p>&nbsp;While we await the results, let us also remember to celebrate their
efforts, regardless of the results. We can show support for our teens by
showing them through our words and actions that their grades do not define
who they are.</p>
<p>&nbsp;Your support to your teen during this milestone is important. Use
this opportunity to have open conversations and guide them as they consider
their next steps. Please refer below for useful resources to guide your
conversations with your daughter/child. They include resources on social
and emotional support as well as education and career guidance.</p>
