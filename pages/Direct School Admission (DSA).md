<p><strong>DIRECT SCHOOL ADMISSION FOR SECONDARY SCHOOLS (DSA – SEC)</strong>
</p>
<p>CHIJ St. Theresa’s Convent invites current Primary Six students who seek
to bring out the best in themselves through Sports as part of our distinctive
programmes - our Learning for Life Programme (LLP), or our Performing Arts,
to join the school through the 2024 Direct School Admission – Secondary
(DSA-SEC) Exercise.</p>
<p>Parents and students are encouraged to choose schools wisely based on
the student’s aptitudes and strengths, bearing in mind the school’s academic
and non-academic requirements, and the programmes available to develop
the area of talent.</p>
<p>Students who are successfully admitted to the school via DSA are expected
to honour their commitment to the school, and participate in the activities
related to the talent they are selected for during their secondary school
years.</p>
