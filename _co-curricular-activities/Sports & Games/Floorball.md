<h4><strong>Introduction</strong></h4>
<p><strong>Floorball- Respect all, fear no one! FINAL</strong></p>
<p>Floorbal was officially offered as a CCA beginning in 2010. We have been taking part in the National Schools Games Floorball Championship since 2009. We aim to forge good relationships with one another, as well as to develop perseverance and resilience. Through the Floorball CCA programme, we value every individual and equip them with skills in Floorball and other competencies required to serve the school and the community.Students can look forward to increasing their physical fitness as well as taking part in a sport that never has a dull moment</p>
