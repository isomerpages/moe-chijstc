<h4><strong>Introduction</strong></h4>
<p><strong>Track and Field - Always fighters, never quitters!</strong>
</p>
<p>STC Track &amp; Field may have had a place in the school history as one
of the oldest CCA’s in our school. With the characters shaped and the attitudes
carried forward, our athletes fight with strong passion and great determination.
Driven by our motto "Always Fighters, Never Quitters!” we greatly believe
in giving our utmost effort in all we do.</p>
<p>In our CCA, track and field, we aim to unite everyone, always encouraging
one another to achieve our utmost potential while developing great determination
and a correct attitude to persist during the tough workouts. Students who
join our CCA will have many opportunities and experiences that helped build
our character, overcoming obstacles and strengthening our abilities. Through
the tough competitions, we have challenged our abilities to greater heights.
Braving through the many competitors in the various events, we have achieved
stupendous victories in the various Nationals School competition. Through
the many moments, it is the shared memories we hold strong as a team.</p>
