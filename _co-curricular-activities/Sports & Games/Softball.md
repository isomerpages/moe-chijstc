<h4><strong>Introduction</strong></h4>
<p><strong>Softball - Speed, Win, Game (S.W.I.N.G) FINAL</strong>
</p>
<p>The softball team in CHIJ St. Theresa’s Convent was formed in 2004. It
started out as a small CCA, barely making a team. Eventually, the team
expanded, leading to our current team of passionate and committed players.
With guidance under our coach and consistent practice, we learn advance
planning and clear communication among players. After all, softball is
a strategic game that requires strong mental focus.</p>
<p>Every year, we participate in the Softball National Schools B and C Division
Championships. STC softball team is always known for our team spirit and
it is with this spirit that we ‘Hit, Run, Score’ in every game we play.&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>What you should know.&nbsp;</strong>
</p>
<p>Achievement does not come without hard work. During the softball season,
we train three times a week. We practise the essential skills constantly
under the guidance of our coach. &nbsp;Speed is also very important as
we need to reach our bases without being called out. Thus, we conduct speed
and agility training. Softball is a very strategic game. It takes strong
mental focus, advance planning and sound decision making skills.&nbsp;</p>
<p>During the off–season, we focus on physical training to build up our stamina
and strength in time for the next season, always keeping in mind our target
of being Top 4.</p>
<p>Every year, the softball team organises team building activities such
as BBQs and dinners. Also, under the Sports Education Programme (SEP),
we participate in various sports activities as a team. In the past years,
we have gone for bowling, dragon boating, handball and sport climbing.
Activities such as these keep the team bonded and strong. As teammates,
we are always there for one another.</p>
