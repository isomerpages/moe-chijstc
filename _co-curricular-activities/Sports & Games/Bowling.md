<h4><strong>Introduction</strong></h4>
<p><strong>Tenpin Bowling: Leave No Pin Standing</strong></p>
<p>The CHIJ St. Theresa&rsquo;s Convent Tenpin Bowling team trains by the motto of &ldquo;Steadfast, Tenacious, Committed&rdquo; through a programme carefully designed to develop its members&rsquo; potential and love for the sport. We seek to nurture each member to exercise discipline and pursue continual self-improvement, by supporting each and every member in a warm and vibrant team culture.</p>
<p>Although the CCA was started in 2006, making it one of the newest CCA&rsquo;s in STC, it has been growing into a noteworthy competitor. In recent years, the team has consistently performed in the top 10 in the National Schools Tenpin Bowling Championships, achieving 3rd runner up in the National School Games 2019 &lsquo;B&rsquo; Division&nbsp;Championships.</p>
<p>The lane can be a stressful and trying environment when we push ourselves to succeed, but as one team we spur one another on with acceptance and guidance at all times.</p>
