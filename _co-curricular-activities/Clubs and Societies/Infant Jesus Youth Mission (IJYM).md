<h4><strong>Introduction</strong></h4>
<p><strong>IJYM - Serving the disadvantaged</strong></p>
<p>The Infant Jesus Youth Mission (IJYM) is a mission CCA which enables its members to give back to the society and be a person for others. Being in IJYM allows students to be in the shoes of others, experiencing what others go through in life, especially the less fortunate in the community. We strive to be the light to others, and to serve with our hearts.</p>
<p>By doing the simplest things with great love and having the compassion to serve, being in IJYM allows us to share what we have with those around us, leaving footprints through our commitment and contribution to the community. Every year, we participate in the IJ Youth Mission Inter-School Competition. This competition looks at the quality of our reflections, year-end presentation and commitment to our service organisations, CCA activities in school as well as in combined school activities.</p>
<p><strong>Vision<br></strong>The CHIJ Youth is transformed by the experience of servant leadership.</p>
<p><strong>Essential Understanding<br></strong>The call from the disadvantaged, for justice, peace and joy, is the ground of our service with freedom and out of love.</p>
