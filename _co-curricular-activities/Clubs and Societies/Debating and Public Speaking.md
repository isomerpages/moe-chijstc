<p><strong>Debating and Public Speaking: The Art of Engaging the Mind and the Heart</strong></p>
<p>The Debating and Public Speaking Club aims to encourage the critical abilities and thought process presented with confidence during public speaking platforms. This is to pick out the best in those with a talent for the spoken and in so doing, create opportunities for students to present cogent and coherent arguments with reasoning, style and passion.</p>
<p>The&nbsp;club&nbsp;has various activities in the year. One of the most prominent events is the Singapore Secondary Schools Debates Championships jointly organized by Julia Gabriel Speech and Drama School and the Debates Association. This platform is a challenging and&nbsp;a good testing ground for debaters to show their flair and their logical reasoning as the annual tournament is attended by many schools with different levels of experience.</p>
<p>Another event is the Mock Parliament, an annual event organised by the Debating and Public Speaking Club held at the Arts House. It is based on the British Parliamentary debating style in which Secondary Three students become parliamentarians arguing on various issues. All these enhance the awareness and the viability of open discussion in deciding opinions on socio-economic cum political platforms.</p>
