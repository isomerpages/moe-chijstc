<h4><strong>Introduction</strong></h4>
<p><strong>Infocomm Club - Technology Connects Us, Unites Us, Amplifies Our Power</strong></p>
<p>The Infocomm Club is always in search of opportunities for our members to offer their expertise within the school and beyond. The club has thus far played a crucial role in rendering services to the school in providing video and photographic coverage of school events.</p>
<p>Our members have participated in national photography, video and design competitions. We look forward to expanding programming knowledge in our members, in line with the Nationâ€™s Smart Nation Masterplan. We are also constantly improving and innovating our members' photography and videography skills.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The Infocomm Club is driven to move the school to be inspired to create. The club is always in search of opportunities for its members to offer their expertise within the school and beyond. Thus far, the club has played a crucial role in rendering services to the school in providing video and photographic coverage of school events. It has also produced commemorative and documentary videos for the IJ community. Two of these videos have even been shipped to Tokyo, Ireland and France for use by IJ schools in these countries. It is the expressed wish of the club to strive to showcase its talents to vast audiences and therefore, raise the profile of the club.</p>
