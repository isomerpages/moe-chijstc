<h4><strong>Introduction</strong></h4>
<p><strong>Drama CCA</strong>
</p>
<p>CHIJ STC's English Drama Club seeks to provide opportunities to develop
students’ talents and lifelong passion for the theatrical arts. Through
building students’ foundation in acting and stagecraft, the Drama Club
aims to help students build their character and confidence to speak and
express themselves in front of a large audience. They work towards annual
productions within the school, and have worked in collaboration with other
schools and organisations. In 2024, students will be involved in the production
of STC Drama Night, showcasing their talents in acting, singing, scriptwriting
and even songwriting. The Drama Club has attained a Certificate of Distinction
for the SYF Arts Presentation in 2023, 2021 and 2019.</p>
