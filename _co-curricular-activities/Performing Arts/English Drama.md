<h4><strong>Introduction</strong></h4>
<p>CHIJ STC's English Drama Club seeks to provide opportunities to develop
students’ talents and lifelong</p>
<p>passion for the theatrical arts. Through building students’ foundation
in acting and stagecraft, the</p>
<p>Drama Club aims to help students build their character and confidence
to speak and express themselves</p>
<p>in front of a large audience. They work towards annual productions within
the school, and have worked</p>
<p>in collaboration with other schools and organisations. In 2024, students
will be involved in the</p>
<p>production of STC Drama Night, showcasing their talents in acting, singing,
scriptwriting and even</p>
<p>songwriting. The CCA is coached by instructors from MySuperFuture, and
have attained a Certificate of</p>
<p>Distinction for the SYF Arts Presentation in 2023, 2021 and 2019.</p>
