<h4><strong>Introduction</strong></h4>
<p><strong>Guitar - Strum with commitment, play with graciousness, reach out with music</strong></p>
<p>The Guitar Ensemble is a CCA which provides opportunities to enable members to learn guitar skills, to challenge their potential and develop leadership skills. We are actively involved in school events and also take part in the yearly Guitar Festival Exchange Programme where students are given the opportunity to learn from other ensembles.</p>
<p>The members are encouraged to learn from one another, to share their skills and to work in a team. Beyond teaching members the skills to play the guitar, the training and performances aim to help them discover their talents and to hone these in a disciplined and yet enjoyable manner. We continue to strive towards gaining more experience in performing so that each member will fulfil her potential.</p>
