<h4><strong>Introduction</strong></h4>
<p><strong>Choir - Lifting our voices in heartmony</strong></p>
<p>STC Choir gives students the opportunity to learn, perform and experience many types of music at various different functions. The choral programme exists to:&nbsp;</p>
<ul>
<li>represent, symbolise and advance the public image of STC and its community.&nbsp;</li>
<li>provide an avenue for students wanting to continue developing their musical skills.&nbsp;</li>
<li>share the love of music and music-making.&nbsp;</li>
<li>actively work at building school spirit in the STC community.&nbsp;</li>
</ul>
<p>The choir has performed a rich and diverse repertoire, including Japanese folk songs and hit numbers from musicals. Besides choral exchanges with local and international choirs, the choir have also held their own performance at the Esplanade Recital studio for the past 3 years, with resounding reviews from the audience.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The Choir hope to build up a stronger foundation in Music theory, vocal techniques, and gain more exposure in performing by participating in more performances both in and out of school, and take part in more Choral exchanges with other school choirs.&nbsp;</p>
