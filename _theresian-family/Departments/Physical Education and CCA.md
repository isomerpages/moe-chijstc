</li>
</ol>
<p><strong>Learning Outcomes<br></strong>Outdoor Education at the Secondary
Level builds upon the knowledge, skills and attitudes that were acquired
at the primary level to explore the natural and urban environments safely
and responsibly. The learning experiences are set in the authentic contexts
of a residential camp in the lower secondary level and an expedition-based
camp by Secondary 3. Students will learn how to prepare for these contexts,
move through the respective environments with others confidently and safely
while ensuring that your basic needs are met. Moreover, you develop a multitude
of outdoor knowledge, skills and attitudes that enable you to enjoy the
camping experiences with your peers.
<br>Outdoor Education provides opportunities for theoretical concepts such
as risk management to be enacted in authentic outdoor settings. It focuses
on three strands, namely:</p>
<ol data-tight="true" class="tight">
<li>
<p>a) Enhancing physical health and wellbeing;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>b) Building competency in assessing and managing risk; and</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>c) Developing a sense of place.</p>
