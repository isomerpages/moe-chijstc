</ol>
<p><strong>Learning Outcomes<br /></strong>Outdoor Education at the Secondary Level builds upon the knowledge, skills and attitudes that were acquired at the primary level to explore the natural and urban environments safely and responsibly. The learning experiences are set in the authentic contexts of a residential camp in the lower secondary level and an expedition-based camp by Secondary 3. Students will learn how to prepare for these contexts, move through the respective environments with others confidently and safely while ensuring that your basic needs are met. Moreover, you develop a multitude of outdoor knowledge, skills and attitudes that enable you to enjoy the camping experiences with your peers.<br />Outdoor Education provides opportunities for theoretical concepts such as risk management to be enacted in authentic outdoor settings. It focuses on three strands, namely:</p>
<ol>
<li>a) Enhancing physical health and wellbeing;</li>
<li>b) Building competency in assessing and managing risk; and</li>
<li>c) Developing a sense of place.</li>
