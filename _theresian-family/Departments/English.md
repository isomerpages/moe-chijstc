<p><strong>Key Programmes</strong>
	
STC Reads<br>
	STC Reads is a school-wide initiative designed to cultivate the joy of reading and nurture a community of thoughtful, passionate readers. Students are exposed to a diverse range of genres—fiction, commentary, poetry, speeches and more—to broaden their perspectives and develop the habit of reading widely and with curiosity.

As part of the programme, students:
- Participate in our Book Exchange, where they share well-loved titles with peers, discover new authors, and experience the joy of reading as a communal and relational act.
- Access curated resources through STC Reads Portal which features our school newsletter, Theresian Threads, as well as book recommendations to support independent and interest-driven reading.
- Engage with guest speakers from the National Library Board (NLB), who conduct talks to promote love for reading

Together, these experiences foster a vibrant reading culture where students read for pleasure, think deeply about the world around them, and grow into confident lifelong readers who use stories and ideas to understand themselves and others.

		STC Creative Writing Programme<br>
The STC Creative Writing Programme nurtures students who show strong interest and aptitude in writing. Through targeted enrichment sessions such as the Creative Writing Camp, students deepen their skills in creative expression, narrative craft, and editorial refinement. They explore a range of writing forms—from personal essays and short stories to poetry and songs—and learn to develop their confidence and sensitivity to audience, purpose, and context.

Students engage in:
- The Creative Writing Camp led by teachers and invited practitioners, where they experiment with literary techniques and storytelling strategies.
- Publication opportunities, such as contributing to Theresian Threads, allowing students to share their ideas with wider audiences and experience the pride of authorship.
- Writing Events or Competitions such as the Queen’s Commonwealth Essay Competition, Live On Writing Competition

This programme aims to inspire students to see writing not just as a skill, but as a form of personal voice, creative expression, and meaningful influence. 
	

Literature on stage

Lit on Stage is a signature Literature programme in STC that brings texts to life through performance. The upper secondary Literature students step into the roles, voices, and worlds of the characters they study in their Literature texts —exploring how language, movement, and expression shape meaning. 

Through stage performances, students:
- Deepen their understanding of character motivation, relationships, themes, and dramatic techniques
- Develop expressive confidence in voice and physicality
- Learn to collaborate, listen, adapt, and support one another as a creative ensemble

The programme begins with a learning journey to watch a live theatre performance and culminates in performance showcases, where students present scenes from their lit texts to the school. These showcases honour students’ interpretive choices and creative risks, spotlighting their ability to communicate ideas with presence and clarity. Lit on Stage also nurtures student agency. Students make decisions about staging, tone, movement, and emphasis—learning that their perspectives shape the meaning of a text. In doing so, they become active meaning-makers, discovering that Literature invites interpretation and personal voice.
