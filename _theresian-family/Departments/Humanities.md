<p><strong>"The calling of the Humanities is to make us truly human in the best sense of the word."&nbsp;-- J. Irwin Miller</strong></p>
<p><strong>Mission<br></strong>To develop critical and innovative thinkers who are imbued with inquiring minds, enabling them to anticipate and respond to global changes in a socially responsible manner as they make links with what they have learnt to the real world contexts.</p>
<p><strong>Investigative and Inquiry-based Learning<br></strong>Students will experience investigative and inquiry-based learning by conducting geographical investigation, historical investigation and issue investigation for Geography, History and Social Studies subjects respectively</p>
<p><strong><u>Geographical Investigation</u></strong>&nbsp;(GI) is a form of geographical inquiry where students are required to investigate a geographical issue and demonstrate their learning by completing an end product. Students follow a guided framework when doing the geographical investigation. They analyse an assigned GI question; gather data online from publications and from the field; analyse data to construct geographical interpretations; consolidate and reflect as a group and as an individual of their findings to form a conclusion.</p>
<p><strong><u>Historical Investigation</u></strong>&nbsp;(HI) is designed to provide opportunities for students to apply and deepen their learning on specific historical concepts and skills. Students are tasked to inquire an authentic historical issue and demonstrate their learning by forming a groupâ€™s response to the HI question as well as completing an end-product</p>
<p><strong><u>Social Studies Issue Investigation</u></strong>&nbsp;(II) is a performance task designed to provide a platform for students to demonstrate the knowledge, skills and values needed for active citizenship. Students conduct investigations on societal issues of meaning to them, extend their inquiry skills by working as a group to identify a societal issue that is a cause of concern and gather data that reflects multiple perspectives. They then analyse the data gathered to surface trends and patterns to arrive at well-reasoned and substantiated conclusions, after considering possible recommendations to the societal issue. Eventually, they reflect on their understanding of the societal issue and examine personal assumptions and beliefs.</p>
