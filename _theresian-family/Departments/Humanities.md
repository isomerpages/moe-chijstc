<p><strong>"The calling of the Humanities is to make us truly human in the best sense of the word."&nbsp;-- J. Irwin Miller</strong>
</p>
<p><strong>Mission<br></strong>To develop critical and innovative thinkers
who are imbued with inquiring minds, enabling them to anticipate and respond
to global changes in a socially responsible manner as they make links with
what they have learnt to the real world contexts.</p>
<p><strong>Investigative and Inquiry-based Learning<br></strong>Students
will experience investigative and inquiry-based learning by conducting
geographical investigation, historical investigation and issue investigation
for Geography, History and Social Studies subjects respectively</p>
<p><strong><u>Geographical Investigation</u></strong>&nbsp;(GI) is a form
of geographical inquiry where students are required to investigate a geographical
issue and demonstrate their learning by completing an end product. Students
follow a guided framework when doing the geographical investigation. They
analyse an assigned GI question; gather data online from publications and
from the field; analyse data to construct geographical interpretations;
consolidate and reflect as a group and as an individual of their findings
to form a conclusion.</p>
<p><strong><u>Historical Investigation</u></strong>&nbsp;(HI) is designed
to provide opportunities for students to apply and deepen their learning
on specific historical concepts and skills. Students are tasked to inquire
an authentic historical issue and demonstrate their learning by forming
a groupâ€™s response to the HI question as well as completing an end-product</p>
<p><strong><u>Social Studies Issue Investigation</u></strong>&nbsp;(II) is
a performance task designed to provide a platform for students to demonstrate
the knowledge, skills and values needed for active citizenship. Students
conduct investigations on societal issues of meaning to them, extend their
inquiry skills by working as a group to identify a societal issue that
is a cause of concern and gather data that reflects multiple perspectives.
They then analyse the data gathered to surface trends and patterns to arrive
at well-reasoned and substantiated conclusions, after considering possible
recommendations to the societal issue. Eventually, they reflect on their
understanding of the societal issue and examine personal assumptions and
beliefs.</p>
