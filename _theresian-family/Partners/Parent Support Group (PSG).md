![](/images/PSG_LOGO.png)<p><strong><u>Introduction</u></strong></p>
<p>       
At CHIJ St. Theresa’s Convent, we believe in journeying together with parents to nurture every Theresian with love, purpose, and partnership. The Parent Support Group (PSG) plays a vital role in this mission by working closely with the school to build a caring, inclusive and values-driven community rooted in our IJ values of love, truth, justice and freedom.

Each year, the PSG supports a meaningful slate of school-wide activities that reflect our shared commitment to care, encouragement and community. These include initiatives such as Chinese New Year care packages for students on the Financial Assistance Scheme (FAS), Easter messages of thanks, prayer packs for graduating students, Graduation Day decorations and Chillout Day celebrations. These regular touchpoints create memorable experiences for our students and foster a strong culture of support and belonging.

Our work is driven by three dedicated sub-committees:

*   **Student Fusion**, which partners with the school to plan and run student-centric activities that celebrate joy, community and growth;
*   **Change-Makers**, which leads outreach and giving efforts through donations, volunteerism and acts of kindness;
*   **Faith Journey**, which supports our Catholic identity through prayerful initiatives that nurture the spiritual life of the school.

Through these efforts, parent volunteers affirm each child’s potential and strengthen the home-school bond. The PSG stands as a trusted partner in the Theresian journey, walking alongside our girls with hearts and hands ready to serve.

We would like to encourage new parents to come forward to share their expertise to provide a holistic education for the students and help to organize activities for parents and students that promote family bonding.&nbsp;We believe that through these activities will your girls further enhance a better relationship with you.</p>
