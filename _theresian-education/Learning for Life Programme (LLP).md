<p><strong><u>Distinctive Programmes</u></strong></p>
<p>1.&nbsp;Hockey</p>
<p><strong><u>Background</u></strong></p>
<p><u></u>At CHIJ St. Theresa&rsquo;s Convent, Hockey is a prominent sport with a strong tradition. The history of hockey in the school and the nature of the sport allow the larger goals of education to be met. The Theresian Hockey story provides rich illustrations and a strong background to instill the school values in all Theresians. It took the commitment, courage and passion of both staff and students over the years to build the strong reputation that CHIJ St. Theresa&rsquo;s Convent now has in hockey.&nbsp;These individuals are truly&nbsp;&ldquo;Leaders and Learners for God and for others&rdquo;. Both on and off the Hockey pitch, these Theresians uphold our school values of Truth, Justice, Freedom and Love.</p>
<p><strong><u>Achievements&nbsp;in Hockey CCA</u></strong></p>
<p>Since the early 1960&rsquo;s, the school has consistently produced many players for the Hockey National Team. Theresian hockey players have made an impact on the Singapore sporting scene. Of the team of 16 players that won the Gold Medal at the 1993 SEA Games held in Singapore, 11 were Theresians. At the 1997 Asia Cup Tournament where Singapore was placed second, 13 of the 16-member squad were Theresians. In 1999 at the Arufura Games in Darwin, the team that won the Gold medal comprised 9 Theresians.</p>
<p>At the National Schools Hockey Tournaments, CHIJ St. Theresa&rsquo;s Convent was the B Division Champion for 19 out of 24 years in the period 1974 to 1998. At the Secondary Schools Sports Council South Zone and National Colours Awards ceremonies, CHIJ St. Theresa&rsquo;s Convent Hockey Team continues to bring honour to the school. The school&rsquo;s prowess in hockey has given it an identity that is synonymous with this rigorous sport.</p>
<p>Through Hockey, Theresians uphold the school&rsquo;s vision of &ldquo;Being Leaders and Learners for God and for others&rsquo;. When they play their games, they demonstrate teamwork, unity and pride for school and nation. Through both recreational and competitive Hockey, our Theresians learn values and skills that help them to navigate through life.</p>

<p><strong><u>Hockey Programme</u></strong></p>
<p>The school seeks to develop students&rsquo; interest and competency in Hockey through a&nbsp;<strong><u>three-tier programme&nbsp;</u></strong>that is catered to the varying degree of skills and talents of students:</p>
<p>1) A broad-based programme for lower secondary students new to the sport - This programme will allow students to pick up the basic skills of Hockey and generate an interest in the sport. This will be carried out during PE lessons.</p>
<p>&nbsp;2) A customised programme for competition preparation for school team players - This programme incorporates mental skills preparation, physical conditioning, skills training and competition exposure, both locally and internationally.</p>
<p>&nbsp;3) A third programme which focuses on developing the leadership skills of the players and equipping them with the competencies to serve the school and the community - This student leadership programme, which includes certification for coaching and umpiring serves to equip the Hockey players with leadership skills to reach out to primary schools in the cluster. This is aimed at fostering greater collaboration with cluster schools in order to promote the sport.</p>
<p>Going forward, CHIJ St. Theresa&rsquo;s Convent hopes to build on its unique strengths in Hockey to develop Theresians who are self-directed, confident and resilient leaders, learners and ladies through sports. Through the Hockey Programme and Physical and Sports Education Programme, we hope to foster a school culture that embraces sports, a culture that seeks to strengthen the character and resilience of Theresians through an active lifestyle for lifelong learning.&nbsp;</p>
