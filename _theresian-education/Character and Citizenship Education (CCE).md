<h4><strong>The Theresian Approach to Citizenship &amp; Character Education (CCE)</strong></h4>
<p><em><strong>'</strong></em>The school takes a 3 &lsquo;A&rsquo;s approach of "Awareness-Actions-Attitudes" to nurture Theresians of character and competence into active citizens who will contribute to the community and nation. Through KNOWLEDGE building, AWARENESS is enhanced. The mastery of SKILLS will guide students&rsquo; ACTIONS. Through the implicit and explicit teaching of values, ATTITUDES will be shaped eventually.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The desired competencies and character traits are encapsulated in the Portrait of the Theresian Girl. The Behavioural Outcomes under the 4 Theresian Values serve as the 4 Level Outcomes in our CCE Curriculum, shown as follows:.</p>

<p>The Theresian Code of Conduct describes the behaviour that all Theresian students should aspire towards. The School Rules and 4 Self-Management Questions guide and re-direct Theresians in their actions so that they can constantly answer the call to be &ldquo;a light to others&rdquo;.</p>
<p>1. Is this HONEST? Am I promoting TRUTH?</p>
<p>2. Is this FAIR? Am I promoting JUSTICE?</p>
<p>3. Is this KIND? Am I promoting LOVE?</p>
<p>4. Am I being a <strong><em>LIGHT&nbsp;</em></strong>to others?</p>
