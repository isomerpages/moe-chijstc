<h4><strong>The Theresian Approach to Citizenship &amp; Character Education (CCE)</strong></h4>
<p><strong><em>'</em></strong>The school takes a 3 ‘A’s approach of "Awareness-Actions-Attitudes"
to nurture Theresians of character and competence into active citizens
who will contribute to the community and nation. Through KNOWLEDGE building,
AWARENESS is enhanced. The mastery of SKILLS will guide students’ ACTIONS.
Through the implicit and explicit teaching of values, ATTITUDES will be
shaped eventually.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The desired competencies and character traits are encapsulated in the
Portrait of the Theresian Girl. The Behavioural Outcomes under the 4 Theresian
Values serve as the 4 Level Outcomes in our CCE Curriculum, shown as follows:.</p>

<p>The Theresian Code of Conduct describes the behaviour that all Theresian
students should aspire towards. The School Rules and 4 Self-Management
Questions guide and re-direct Theresians in their actions so that they
can constantly answer the call to be “a light to others”.</p>
<p>1. Is this HONEST? Am I promoting TRUTH?</p>
<p>2. Is this FAIR? Am I promoting JUSTICE?</p>
<p>3. Is this KIND? Am I promoting LOVE?</p>
<p>4. Am I being a <strong><em>LIGHT&nbsp;</em></strong>to others?</p>
