Convent (STC)’s key Educational Career Guidance (ECG) programmes are undergirded
by four themes to meet our students’ development needs.&nbsp;</p>

<p><strong><u>Secondary 1<br></u></strong>At Secondary 1, students are introduced
to the ECG portal . It helps them develop self-awareness of their career
interests, skills and work values through assessments, which they can access
online at the portal at any time. The portal also contains information
on Post-Secondary Education Institutions (PSEIs) and information on various
occupations.</p>
<p><strong><u>Secondary 2<br></u></strong>At Secondary 2, students go through
a Customised Subject Option Exercise Briefing to better understand the
subject offerings in STC before making a decision on the subject combination
to take at Secondary 3. Ex-Theresians studying in the various PSEIs are
invited to have in-depth conversations with the students on their education
and career pathways. During class-time, teachers go through the ECG Parent
Guide “The Explorer’s Passport” with the students Students are encouraged
to explore the activities in the guide with their parents, so that they
can gain a better understanding of the careers suitable for them together
with their parents. Normal Technical (NT) students are given an opportunity
to participate in the “Experience ITE Programme”, a 1-day programme which
orientates students in ITE education to discover how ITE education can
help advance their careers. They also get to participate in an ITE Elective
Module, which is a short course specially designed and offered by ITE to
broaden the students’ learning experiences.</p>
<p><strong><u>Secondary 3<br></u></strong>At Secondary 3, all Express and
Normal Academic (NA) students go to Singapore Polytechnic for the Applied
Studies Experience and Industry Exposure programme, which aims to create
greater awareness in students on study and career options through applied
learning at Polytechnics. Students may have the opportunity to sign up
for a work attachment or learning journeys to observe others at work and
carry out simple tasks under the guidance of a mentor. To provide NA students
with a broader view of the available post-secondary education paths, they
also have the opportunity to attend a 2-day Experience ITE programme at
different ITE colleges. NT students participate in another two ITE Elective
Modules to further broaden their ITE learning experience.</p>
<p><strong><u>Secondary 4 &amp; 5<br></u></strong>At Secondary 4 &amp; 5,
all graduating students attend career talks provided by Ex-Theresians,
parents and industry partners. Ex-Theresians are also invited to have conversations
with the graduating students on their education and career pathways. These
conversations will take place during a Form Teacher Guidance Period and
through a Circle Sharing session, to allow students to engage in deeper
and in-depth dialogue with the ex-Theresians. The Higher Education Fair
is organised every year. Various PSEIs are invited to set up booths and
give talks to students Parents are also invited to view the booths.</p>
