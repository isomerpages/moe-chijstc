<h4><strong>Introduction</strong></h4>
<p><strong>ANGKLUNG ENSEMBLE: The World Awakes When The Bamboo Sings</strong></p>
<p>The Angklung and Kulintang Ensemble CCA brings the essence of Indonesia to CHIJ St. Theresa&rsquo;s Convent. The ensemble essentially comprises Indonesian traditional instruments - the angklung and the kulintang. Each angklung is a bamboo rattle which originates from the Sunda province of West Java. The kulintang is a xylophone version from Manado, North Sulawesi. Both are popular musical instruments which are often accompanied by Eastern and Western percussions.</p>
<p>Everyone can enjoy the melodious sounds of the bamboo merely by shaking and tapping the instruments together in an ensemble that aims always to nurture each and every member into the best musician that she can be. Through careful tutelage and guidance, playing the angklung and kulintang offers opportunities for Theresians to learn values such as teamwork, confidence and inclusiveness &ndash; essential ingredients to the betterment and success of any social fabric.</p>
