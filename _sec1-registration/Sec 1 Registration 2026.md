</p>
<p><strong>The Theresian Community welcomes all our 2026 Sec 1 Students and Parents!</strong>
</p>
<p>We are pleased that you have made CHIJ St. Theresa's Convent (STC) your
school of choice. You are entering into a new and an exciting phase of
school life. At CHIJ STC, we aim to involve you in all aspects of school
life to develop a strong community of leaders and learners for God and
for others. For the students, we understand that transiting from primary
to secondary school is a big step and that many of you will need time to
adjust to a new environment and new expectations. There will be numerous
opportunities to learn and to forge new friendships.</p>
<p>When you receive your posting to CHIJ St Theresa’s Convent, you do not
need to be physically present in our school on that day as the Sec 1 Registration
will be conducted online.</p>

online e-registration on Sec 1 Registration Day. After you have received
your school posting, CHIJ St. Theresa’s Convent should be automatically
reflected on the Parents Gateway app and you will be able to receive notifications
from our school.</p>
<p>On Sec 1 Registration Day, you will receive a notification via the Parents
Gateway app to complete the online e-registration form on FormSG. This
will allow you to complete the Sec 1 registration online. Please complete
and submit the form before [TBC]. The link to the form is [TBC].</p>
<p>For students who intend to put in an appeal to another school, you will
still need to fill up this form and notify CHIJ STC General Office should
you be successful in your appeal.</p>
