</p>
<p><strong>The Theresian Community welcomes all our 2026 Sec 1 Students and Parents!</strong>
</p>
<p>We are pleased that you have made CHIJ St. Theresa's Convent (STC) your
school of choice. You are entering into a new and an exciting phase of
school life. At CHIJ STC, we aim to involve you in all aspects of school
life to develop a strong community of leaders and learners for God and
for others. For the students, we understand that transiting from primary
to secondary school is a big step and that many of you will need time to
adjust to a new environment and new expectations. There will be numerous
opportunities to learn and to forge new friendships.</p>
<p>When you receive your posting to CHIJ St Theresa’s Convent, you do not
need to be physically present in our school on that day as the Sec 1 Registration
will be conducted online.</p>
