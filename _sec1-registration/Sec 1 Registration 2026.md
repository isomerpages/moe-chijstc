<p><strong>2026 theme: Lead with Love, Shine with Purpose</strong>
</p>
<p><strong>The Theresian Community welcomes all our 2026 Sec 1 Students and Parents!</strong>
</p>
<p>We are pleased that you have made CHIJ St. Theresa's Convent (STC) your
school of choice. You are entering into a new and an exciting phase of
school life. At STC, we aim to involve you in all aspects of school life
to develop a strong community of leaders and learners for God and for others.
For the students, we understand that transiting from primary to secondary
school is a big step and that many of you will need time to adjust to a
new environment and new expectations. There will be numerous opportunities
to learn and to forge new friendships.</p>
<p>When you receive your posting to STC, there is no need for students and
their parents to be physically present in school as the Sec 1 registration
process will take place online.</p>
<p>In place of a webinar, necessary information will be provided here to
guide you and your daughter through the registration process.</p>
