<p><strong>National Digital Literacy Programme (NDLP) in CHIJ STC<br></strong>The
NDLP was launched at MOE’s Committee of Supply Debate in March 2020 to
help students strengthen their digital literacy. One of the components
of the NDLP is the introduction of the Personalised Digital Learning Programme
(“PDLP”) for all secondary school students, whereby every secondary school
student will own a school-prescribed PLD. The PLD will be used together
with the national e-learning platform – the Singapore Student Learning
Space (“SLS”) – as well as other educational technology to personalise
and enhance students’ learning. This will also enable students to acquire
digital skills and apply these skills as they navigate an increasingly
digitalised world</p>
