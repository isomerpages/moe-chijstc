<p style="text-align: left;"><strong>Our Pioneer Mother</strong><br />Five French sisters, one of whom was Mother Mathilde Raclot, left their homeland. They set sail for Singapore in 1852. Only two out of the five sisters survived the journey in good health.</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">The Apotolic Vicar of Malaya felt that they were too inexperienced to set up a school in Singapore and sent them to Penang. A second group of sisters arrived in Penang in late 1852.</p>

<p style="text-align: left;">Town Convent at Victoria Street was born. Mother Mathilde and her sisters left their homeland and became immigrants, displaced from their comforts and security. Their mission was simple - to educate girls from all social classes, especially the disadvantaged.</p>

<p style="text-align: left;"><strong>The Founding Years</strong><br />As the colonial government struggled to meet the needs of Singapore's expanding population, the IJ sisters kept up with their mission to provide an education to girls. &nbsp;In response to an urgent need to reach out to the poor families in the slums around Kampong Bahru, &nbsp;the sisters started classes at the Church of St. Teresa.</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">For four years, the school was run as a parish school. In 1933, the IJ sisters leased Hood Lodge, the house next to the church, and the parish school became a school of the Infant Jesus order, called St. Theresa's Convent.</p>

The school offered lessons instructed in both English and Tamil. By 1938, the enrolment increased to just 60.</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">As there were no living quarters at Hood Lodge, the sisters who taught there travelled daily from Town Convent in horse drawn carriages on unpaved roads. Our first principal, Madame St. Ignatius was a tall and gentle lady who brought the school through its infanthood as a private school.</p>

St. Theresa's Convent moved to her second home in a house owned by the Christian Brothers who ran St. Joseph's Institution. This intervention by the Bishop greatly encouraged the sisters who once again found strength to rough out the bumpy 12 km journey twice each day to school.</p>

<p style="text-align: left;">The English Section of St. Theresa's functioned in a wooden hut which was abandoned by the Japanese and shared this hut with the Sacred Heart Boys' School.

<p style="text-align: left;">Another gift to the school was Mrs Mabel Tan who joined as a teacher in 1957 and served the school for the next 42 years. Yet another gift to the school was Ms Chan Pui Chen who taught in St. Theresa's for 50 years straight after graduating from Town Convent.&nbsp;</p>

<p style="text-align: left;"><strong>Building Bridges, Making Connections</strong><br />To make St. Theresa's a safer and more inviting environment, a pedstrian overhead bridge into the school compound was built and completed in 2000. The statue of our founder, Fr Nicholas Barre was also installed in the school's foyer on 20 October 2000.</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">Sanctuaire de Barre is a quiet but an important reminder to all who enter the portals of CHIJ St. Theresa's that the school would not be in existence if not for the vision and courage of Fr Nicholas Barre and thecommitment of the IJ sisters.</p>

Situated at the highest level of our school, The Rose Terrace&rsquo;s primary feature is a set of 4 solar panels which generate enough energy to power the light at the terrace. This night light serves as a reminder to present day Theresians that we are still the &lsquo;Light on the Hill&rsquo;.</p>
