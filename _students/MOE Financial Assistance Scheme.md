<p><strong>MOE FINANCIAL ASSISTANCE SCHEME (FAS) 2026</strong>
</p>
<p>The Ministry of Education (MOE) provides financial assistance to eligible
Singapore Citizen students from our Government and Government-Aided Schools
(GGAS) who need financial assistance for their studies.</p>

of $4,000 and below; or</p>
<p>b.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Gross monthly household Per Capita Income
(PCI) of $1,000 and below [<em>PCI refers to monthly GHI divided by the number of family members in the same household as the student</em>]</p>

<p>MOE will onboard the HOMES to streamline applications and means-testing
processes from Academic Year 2026.&nbsp; Means-testing will automatically
take into account the household income of all family members in the same
household as the student and the household’s average income over the past
12 months.&nbsp; All employment and trade income, including bonuses and
allowances, as well as other administrative income as reflected in the
Notice of Assessment by the Inland Revenue Authority of Singapore, such
as rental income, will be included in the income assessment.&nbsp; With
HOMES, most applicants no longer need to submit supporting documents, such
as income documents.</p>
