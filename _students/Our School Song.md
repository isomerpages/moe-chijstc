<p style="text-align: center;"><strong>Light on the Hill</strong></p>
<p style="text-align: center;">See this school up on a hill<br />Quiet, tall and standing still<br />Kampong Bahru's little light<br />Glowing, growing, shining bright</p>
<p style="text-align: center;">Never wavering in its mission<br />Extolling Father Barre's mission<br />Girls were sought and educated<br />Teachers are so dedicated</p>
<p style="text-align: center;">So with zeal and faith inspire<br />Never did the sisters tire<br />Persevered and faced the challenges<br />Ahead of them</p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><strong>Chorus</strong></p>
<p style="text-align: center;">Simple in virtue<br />Steadfast in duty<br />Learn how to learn and<br />Learn how to live</p>
<p style="text-align: center;">Proudly now this building stands<br />High amidst the verdant land<br />Service to others we uphold<br />Fine young women we do mould</p>
<p style="text-align: center;">Keep the light continually burning<br />The light on the hill forever shining<br />Lighting up lives to all who come here<br />Facing the future without fear</p>
<p style="text-align: center;">Forward onward and fulfilling<br />Theresian spirit and tradition<br />Value-based is our rendition<br />Forever we remain</p>
<p style="text-align: center;">Music and lyrics by Mrs Sylvia Liew<br />Orchestration by Dr Kelly Tang</p>
